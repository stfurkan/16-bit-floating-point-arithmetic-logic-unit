16 BIT FLOATING POINT ARITHMETIC LOGIT UNIT

Arithmetic logic unit can have different features such as addition subtraction, multiplication, division, shifting etc. The area of application of arithmetic logic unit can vary according to their features.
In this project, it is aimed to design and verify an arithmetic logic unit which can add and subtract with 16 bit floating point numbers. The calculation of 16 bit floating point numbers is performed based on IEEE 754 standard. The system is designed by using Verilog language.
